# Book A-Cross

## Description

Web-based bookcrossing; a service to exchange books around the globe.

Imagine you want to read some rare book, but you don't have it. Meanwhile in some other place on Earth someone is having it. What if you two could just find each other and fix up that issue? Well, this service is intended to bring this idea to life.

It's simple. If you have a bunch of books that you apparently won't use, just register and then mention book titles that you possess. If you want to find some book you don't have yet, just register and try to reach it through the search.

## Usage

To run the web server on your machine, you need to do following:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install requirements (with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Run Flask Webb App (`run.sh` on LINUX and `run.bat` on Windows)

## Contributing

If you are interested in my idea of web-based bookcrossing, and you want to help this idea to get real, you are welcome to contact me on john.the.theologician@gmail.com. Before the project grows big, I might come up with some `CONTRIBUTING.md` stuff.
